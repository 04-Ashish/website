    <h2>About Dev Bhoomi Uttarakhand</h2>
    <p>Uttarakhand is known as Devbhoomi, or the "land of the gods," since it is home to several Hindu holy sites. Throughout ancient times, Uttarakhand has been revered as Devbhoomi, and the state is currently known as Devbhoomi Uttarakhand in India.</p>
    
    <p>Devbhoomi Uttarakhand is situated in the Himalayan region, surrounded by majestic mountains and serene valleys that are considered the abode of various gods and goddesses. The Ganga, India’s longest and holiest river, originates from the Gangotri Glacier in Uttarakhand’s Uttarkashi district, further adding to the sacredness of the region.</p>

<h3>Capital Of Uttarakhand</h3>
<p>Uttarakhand Now Has 2 different Capital Cities: Dehradun and Gairsain.</p>

<p>Garsain is a lovely town in Uttarakhand’s Chamoli district, some 280 kilometers from Dehradun. This information was provided by the state government in its announcement. “The Governor is pleased to grant the permission to the proclamation of Bhararisen (Gairsain) in division Chamoli as the summer capital of Uttarakhand state,” it says. This follows Opposition Leader Trivendra Singh Rawat’s declaration of Gairsain as Uttarkhand’s summer capital during his budgeting session speech on March 4.</p>

<p>Gairsain has been proclaimed as Uttarakhand’s summer capital, two decades after the state was formed from Uttar Pradesh comprising a separate state. Locals in Uttarakhand have reportedly been calling for capital in Gairsain. This town is located in the Garhwal region, approximately 280 kilometers from the place of Dehradun, the winter’s capital.</p>

<p>Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat expressed his delight at the news. He told the media that it was a great satisfaction for him that the public feelings of Uttarakhand locals and those residing outside the state have come true.</p>

<p>Rawat described the decision as crucial for individuals living in hilly terrain. He claims that this will have a long-term impact on the state’s development. Rawat stated that those living in remote mountainous regions will now have a greater convenience with administrative tasks. He stated that the administration is now working on a thorough strategy for infrastructure development in Gairsain. They are also aiming to improve Gairsain’s accessibility to major Uttarakhand cities. Aside from Gairsain, another reason for visiting Uttarakhand is the world’s largest Tulip Garden.</p>
